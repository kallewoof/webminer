This can mean that the legality of holding or trading </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;is not always clear. Whether and how one or more </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;constitute property, or assets, or rights of any kind may also seem unclear. Participants and users are responsible for knowing and understanding how </span><span>webcash</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will be addressed, regulated and taxed under applicable law.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>2. </span><span class="c2">Fork Risk</span><span>: It is possible that third-parties may fork or otherwise modify </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;software. Forks can bring additional risks that you should study carefully before engaging in any fork, such as the risk of loss of </span><span>webcash</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;even if unintended.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>3. </span><span class="c2">Experimental Risk</span><span>: </span><span>Webcash.tech</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and its Service is an experiment, that is, it is based on experimental technology. Software that has not been widely used, deployed, or tested is less likely to be mature and is more likely to be modified from time to time to fix bugs or discrepancies. Similarly, bugs and errors can persist perhaps indefinitely because of the experimental nature of the software.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>4. </span><span class="c2">Bearer Ris</span><span>k: Webcash is not &quot;registered&quot; in a database linked to anyone&#39;s identity or with any &quot;accounts&quot;. It is your sole responsibility to protect any of your </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;from accidental exposure, theft, or other forms of loss through any means you deem necessary, such as encryption, backups, etc. As a bearer-like asset, </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;only exists as a form of information that can be very easily transferred from one machine to another. With the secret that defines a piece of </span><span>webcash</span><span>, it is possible to steal from or otherwise modify </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;wallets without your knowledge. When you copy and paste </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;or otherwise give </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;to another party, this act cannot be reversed (that is, such actions are irreversible) through the </span><span>webcash</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;protocol and instead must be reversed through that party you interacted with. Be advised that it is your responsibility to protect yourself from these and other risks and employ any mitigations you deem appropriate.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>5. </span><span class="c2">Market Risk</span><span>: The market for </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;is still new and uncertain. No-one should have funds in </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;or speculate regarding </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;using funds that she is not prepared to lose entirely. Whether the market for </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;will move up or down, or whether </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;will lose all or substantially all of its value, is unknown. This applies to both traders that are going long and to traders that are shorting the market. Participants should be cautious about holding and using </span><span>webcash</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>6. </span><span class="c2">Liquidity and Listing Risk</span><span>: Markets for </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;have varying degrees of liquidity. Some are quite liquid while others may be thinner. Thin markets can amplify volatility.

These risks also include security breaches, risk of contractual breaches, and risk of loss. Users should be wary of allowing third-parties to hold their property for any reason. Once you send </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;to a counterparty, whether intentionally or by a fraudulent or accidental transfer, you accept the risk that you may lose access to, and any claim on, those </span><span>webcash</span><span>&nbsp;indefinitely or permanently. Any necessary reversal must be performed by the respective counterparty. &nbsp;Peer-to-peer decentralized </span><span>webcash</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;transactions are not reversible by the Service.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>8. </span><span class="c2">Trading Risk</span><span>: In addition to liquidity risks, values in any digital currency or token marketplace are volatile and can shift quickly.
